          I’ve never been a spiritual person. But you know what they say. Even
          atheists start to pray when the plane is falling.

          At some point (probably some pretty damn low point) I googled things
          to help my anxiety and found a cool looking app. Safe looking. Not
          some woo woo shit. So yeah, Headspace became my gateway drug because
          it focuses on the scientific as well as the spiritual aspects of
          meditation.

          Andy, the voice behind all guided meditations, seemed to be a person
          just like me. Except he’s bald and a man. His voice makes me feel like
          everything is okay. Thank you, Andy.
